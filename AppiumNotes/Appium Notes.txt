Mobile testing

Types of mobile application
 - Native app
 - 
 - 

Native application
	- Platform dependent
	- UI is not attractive
	- faster since it is developed in own language
	- where you install it
	
Hybrid application
	- web application put under a native container
	- works for both android and iOS	
	- platform independent




Appium

1. Appium is an open source tool which is used to automate Mobile Native, Hybrid, and M Web.

Difference between version 1 & 2

Appium 1
	- Appium 1 had default android and iOS support
	- The url for Appium was http://localhost:4723/wd/hub
	- It supported both JSON WIRE and W3C protocol
	- We were using touch action class to perform actions
	- In Appium1 you could give any capabilibities without vendor prefix "platformName","android"
	- In Appium1 We had Appium desktop

Appium 2 
	- Appium 2 doesn't have default support needs driver to installed externally.
	- The url for Appium2 is http://localhost:4723
	- It supports W3C protocol
	- Now we are using gestures to platform actions
	- Here we mention only automationName and browserName with vendor prefix "appium:platformName","android"
	- In Appium2 We had Appium inspector.

Appium Architecture

	- Appium Java client [IDE] / Appium inspector
	- Appium Server (http server runs in 4723 port) 
	- Drivers - UI Automator 2(Android driver) / Xcuitest(ios driver) 
	- Devices - android/AVD - Android Virtual Device[emulator] .apk) / ios .psa


Capabilities 
	- Capabilities are nothing but JSON object which can be represented in key value pair.
	- Capabilities says which it should device use, what driver it need to connect, actions and much more to the server
	
bootstap.jar file (Android), WDA (ios) - Application which helps the ios device to perform operation.
